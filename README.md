#Import
This is an Eclipse Project. The libraries used in the project are in the 'lib' folder.
When you import the project to eclipse, change the buildpath for the libs.
*IMPORTANT:* do not forget to change the path for the lwjgl.jar`s natives.

#Assets
You need to copy the LegoRR0/World/Shared folder into the base folder of the project. Then just copy the folder of the model you want to display, and pick the lws file.
